Current problem:



ABC v0.2 of 31-mar-2014 -- http://vsl.cis.udel.edu/abc

Error: No conversion from type of right hand side to that of left:
(void) *
struct MPI_Comm
at gen_redcs_mat.c:449.6-mpi.h:5.22 "new_comm = ((void*) ... )"
make: *** [abc_amg2013] Error 6

Probably what happened is: this file was read in after mpi.h was read.
However in reality, this file will be preprocessed and compiled with other headers
insteaed of mpi.h.  In those headers, MPI_Comm is defined to be int, and
MPI_COMM_NULL is (-1).

Here are the includes:

#include "parcsr_ls.h"
#include "parcsr_mv.h"
#include "seq_mv.h"
#include "par_amg.h"

In parcsr_ls.h:
#include "HYPRE_parcsr_ls.h"
...
#include "utilities.h"

utilities.h includes HYPRE_utilities.h.

In HYPRE_utilities.h, mpi.h is included first.

In utilities.h there is  then a bunch of #defines which redefine MPI_Comm, etc.

In mpi.h:  typedef struct MPI_Comm MPI_Comm;

In utilities.h:
#define MPI_Comm            hypre_MPI_Comm            
...
typedef int hypre_MPI_Comm;
