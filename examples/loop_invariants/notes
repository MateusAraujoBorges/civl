1. Side-effects in loop-condition will be a problem in transformation.
2. Loop must not have goto statements in original code.
3. The assertion failure message printed after running arrayZeroes1d-bad.cvl looks confusing.
4. Think about the last two commented-out lines of code in arrayEqualsNoReturn.cvl
5. Currently no induction heuristic handling for $exist
6. IMPORTANT: why I have to add loop condition into the pushed assumption ?

   if (loop_cond)
      while(true) {
         $assume_push(loop_cond && invariants); // why the loop_cond has to be there ?
         ...
      }
