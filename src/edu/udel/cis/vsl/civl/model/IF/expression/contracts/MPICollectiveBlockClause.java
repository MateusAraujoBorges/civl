/**
 * An MPICollectiveContractClause is a contract clause that appears inside an
 * MPI collective block. An MPI collective block is defined as <br>
 * <code>\mpi_collective(MPI_Comm, Collective_kind): {
 * ...
 * }</code>
 * <p>
 * An MPI collective block is associate to an MPI communicator, it defines the
 * domain of all the communicating properties stated by clauses inside it.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * An MPICollectiveContractClause will be checked and reasoned using an unique
 * semantics and proof system which are specific for MPI programs.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Please be aware of this: it is IMPORTANT to claim that the word "collective"
 * here is somewhat different from the collective routines defined in MPI
 * standard. An MPI collective contracts defines the behavior of a function
 * should satisfy some collective properties no matter if collective routines is
 * used inside the function. e.g. If a function requires all processes in
 * MPI_COMM_WORLD execute itself collectively and inside the function it's just
 * an MPI_Sendrecv routine, this function has a collective behavior.
